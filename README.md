The virtual mouse system is developed using the Python programming language and OpenCV library for computer vision. The system utilizes the MediaPipe package for tracking the hands and detecting the tip of the fingers, while PyAutoGUI packages are used for moving around the window screen and performing functions such as left-click, right-click, and scrolling. It also provide Voice Typing finction by the use of SpeechRecognition and Pynput. The results of the proposed model demonstrate high accuracy levels, indicating that the system can work well in real-world applications even without the use of a GPU.
